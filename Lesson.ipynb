    "Programming, at it's heart, is about being able to reduce the amount of work it takes to accomplish a task. In manufacturing, this would look like building a machine that can accomplish portions of a task with less human effort. By reducing the amount of work that we have to put into a process, we free ourselves up to focus on the tasks that are not so easily accomplished by anyone besides a competent human being (us). \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a program as really tiny machinery. Your goal is to make a machine (in code) that can accomplish routine tasks for you. When you're done, you get to focus on other important tasks that demand your attention. For example, you might want to spend your time working on a forecast model, but first you need to check to make sure that all values in your time series are valid. You COULD just open up your data, and look at every record to make sure that each fits the rules that valid data should follow. Or you could write a program that can check every line for you, and either alert you to problems, or possibly fix them without you even having to be involved. Then, all of your time is freed for the forecasting model.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have used conditions a few times already, but it is time to talk seriously about conditions and logical statements in Python. If you haven't noticed this yet, you will soon note that Python (and all other programming languages) are VERY literal. Things that we don't intend will occur whenever we assume that a computer will interpret an ambiguous statement in a single anticipated (by humans) way. Eventually, you will get used to being very careful when describing conditions in your code, and these problems will become less of an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we have keywords that we can use to express different kinds of logic. Let's get started by talking about `if` statements. `if` statements function in Python pretty much the same way that they do in English: you state a condition, and then explain what should happen if that condition is met. You can then list alternative outcomes with the conditions that should be met prior to implementing those contingency plans. Finally, you can list what to do in any other outcomes that were not explicity described. Let's try this out:"
